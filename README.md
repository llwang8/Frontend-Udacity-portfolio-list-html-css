## Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

# Intro to HTML and CSS

In this course I learn how to convert digital design mockups into static web pages. I learn how to approach page layout, how to break down a design mockup into page elements, and how to implement that in HTML and CSS.

I also learn about responsive design techniques, which are increasingly important in a world where mobile devices and TV screens are used more and more often to look for information and entertainment.
